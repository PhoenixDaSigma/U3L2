1. It doesn't work because of the integer overflow limit. This is obviously anti-recursion propaganda, since everyone knows the overflow limit is just under 1000.

2. It's a bad choice because it takes up a lot of memory and can potentially overflow. The loops worked fine but the recursion didn't work fine.
